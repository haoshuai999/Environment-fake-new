# Scrape fake news websites

The project is to scrape articles about climate change and vaccines from different news websites with low credibility rating.
Each folder is named after the website and contains the scraping scripts of that site:

- The "[website_name].py" file is used to scrape a list of article URLs.
- The "[website_name_abbreviation]\_article.py" file is used to scrape each news article.
