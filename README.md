# Scrape fake news websites

The project is to scrape articles about climate change from different news websites with low credibility rating.
Each folder is named after the website and contains the scraping scripts that site:

- The "[website_name].py" file is used to scrape a list of articles URLs.
- The "[website_name_abbreviation].py" file is used to scrape each article.
